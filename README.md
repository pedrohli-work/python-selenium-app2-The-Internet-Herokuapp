# Selenium Test Automation Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **Selenium-based test automation dashboard** built for learning and practicing web automation concepts.  
It provides a **Streamlit interface** to run automated tests, display live outputs, and summarize results with color-coded test statuses.

> **Python Version:** 3.11 (adjusted for Streamlit Cloud compatibility)  

## Key Concepts Used in This Iteration
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Encapsulation of page interactions in reusable classes.
- **Logger Integration:** Consistent logging for debugging and traceability.
- **Pytest + Selenium:** Structured test automation framework.
- **Streamlit Dashboard:** Real-time test execution and summary visualization.

## Features
- Run **all tests** at once or select individual tests.
- Live output of tests displayed in the dashboard.
- Summary report of test results with **color-coded statuses**.
- Session-based dashboard reset to clear outputs **without deleting report files**.
- Handles **iframe text editing** tests using TinyMCE editor.

## Known Limitations
- For EdgeWebDriver, Streamlit app can not be deployed in the Cloud. Due to WebDriver issues with the Streamlit Cloud
- TinyMCE editor in **free Tiny Cloud plan** may reach monthly editor load limits, affecting iframe tests.
- Some iframe tests may fail if usage limits are exceeded.
- Next iteration will explore **self-hosted TinyMCE** for full test stability.

## Next Iteration Goals
- Implement tests for **SPA-aware applications**.
- Apply **Enterprise-level testing patterns** and best practices.
- Enhance reporting with interactive charts and metrics.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Running the Dashboard
streamlit run app.py

Deployment
The app is compatible with Streamlit Cloud.
Ensure runtime.txt is set to Python 3.11 for compatibility.
Push the repository to GitHub and click “Deploy” on Streamlit Cloud

Note: This iteration focuses on foundational concepts (POM, Logger, Pytest + Selenium).
Future iterations will expand to enterprise-level practices, SPA testing, and enhanced reporting.
